# Advent of Code 2021

An Advent of Code 2021 solver written in Rust.

# Caveats

This software was written for personal use and suffers from a lack of documentation, no warranty of any kind, and is not necessarily representative of quality work.

# Goals

- **Education**. I am still learning Rust.
- **Tests**. I will endeavor to write tests for all examples given for a puzzle.
- **Pragmatism**. I want to have fun, so I may favor simplicity over efficiency. Optimization is often fun, but not always.
